Winning a Triple Crown is one of the most difficult feats in baseball. To do so, a player must lead either the American League or National League in batting average (BA), home runs (HR) and runs-batted-in (RBIs). MLB has had 10 players win a total of 12 Triple Crowns since RBIs became an official statistic in 1920. In 2012, Miguel Cabrera (also known as 'Miggy') won the Triple Crown. My analysis will show by how much Miguel Cabrera won (and just how dominant he was).
